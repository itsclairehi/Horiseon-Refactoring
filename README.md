# Refactoring of the Horiseon website 
## Given a starter code from the Coding Bootcamp at UT, I have: 

* refactored the site to be more SEO-friendly by adding semantic html elements and image alts.
* condensed the CSS so that there is less repeated code, and moved the hero image to the html, resulting in a faster load-time.
* fixed the "Search Engine" button so that the navigation bar works properly.
